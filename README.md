# Intro to Machine Learning - TensorFlow Project

Project code for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree program. In this project, I developed code for an image classifier built with TensorFlow, then converted it into a command line application.

In order to complete this project, I used the GPU enabled workspaces within the Udacity classroom.

You should also only enable the GPU when you need it. If you are not using the GPU, please disable it so you do not run out of time!

**Data**

The data for this project is quite large - in fact, it is so large you cannot upload it onto Github. If you would like the data for this project, you will want to download it from the workspace in the classroom. Though actually completing the project is likely not possible on your local unless you have a GPU. You will be training using 102 different types of flowers, where there ~20 images per flower to train on. Then you will use your trained classifier to see if you can predict the type for new images of the flowers.
